## Overview
Schedule Visualizer is a Python tool that creates graphical representations of task schedules for multiple agents. It processes CSV files containing agents' tasks, states, and proposed schedules aimed at achieving specific goals.

## How it Works
1. Input CSV: The tool requires a CSV file detailing commands and states of agents over time.
2. Visualization: It then generates a visual representation, showcasing the state of each agent at every step, aiding in understanding and optimizing task schedules.

## Usage
- Run `scheduler_visualization.py` with the CSV file as input.
